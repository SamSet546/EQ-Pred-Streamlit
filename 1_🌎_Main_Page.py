            - Provide an application platform for people to experience both the backend and frontend design of machine learning prediction systems
            - While this application does not offer a thorough walkthrough of the code used, we explain the problem solving process that leads to making accurate predictions 
            - This application may mirror the focus of programming websites and articles like GeeksforGeeks or Medium 
            - For this application, we will showcase an environmental monitoring algorithm trained at predicting the magnitude of earthquakes around the world""")
